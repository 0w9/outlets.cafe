# Find cafes with outlets (+ more) ☕️

**Idea:** On Google you can filter for cafes, sometimes with WiFi. But not for outlets. I, as software developer, need outlets for a long coding session.
This site has a long list of the cafes on Airtable, linked with some metadata.

For that it uses pSEO with dynamic metadata from NextJS to rank higher. Basic but works.
Here's an example: https://outlets.cafe/sf
